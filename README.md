# Trying Not To Lose On Jeopardy!
Tracking my performance across *Jeopardy!*'s 40th season

## Objective
As a lifelong fan of *Jeopardy!*, it's always been a dream of mine to appear on the show. I made it into the contestant pool once before, but didn't wind up getting The Call during my window of eligibility. But it's just as well, because while I may have what it takes to become a contestant, I don't feel confident that I could win a game... yet. 

## Analysis

Check out `jeopardy-season-40-part-one.ipynb` for Part One of my analysis, spanning the first 80 games of Season 40.

Part Two, full-season analysis, can be found at `jeopardy-season-40-part-two.ipynb`

## References
This project would not be possible without the font of information found in [j-archive](https://j-archive.com/showseason.php?season=40). Scraping data from this site is a big no-no, so instead I manually cross-referenced categories, questions and answers when compiling my tracking sheet.

And I'm using real data to determine what those topics are, and how much I need to improve to reliably win.\n\n## Project Scope\nThis analysis will pick up where I left off in part one, comparing my performance across the remainder of the season - with a particular focus on the non-tournament, regular season games.\n\n## Data Collection Method\nAfter playing along with each game in real time, I entered clue-by-clue stats and information into a Google Sheet. I calculated my [Coryat Score](https://j-archive.com/help.php#coryatscore) for each game, and collected additional game data on contestant performance.\n\n## Data Description\nAs I did for the first portion of the season, I exported the data from Google Sheets into two csv tables.\n\n`jeopardy_data_complete.csv` includes the following columns:\n\n* Game - the episode ID number of the game (and the primary key for both tables)\n* Round - Jeopardy!, Double Jeopardy! or Final Jeopardy!\n* Category - The category title as displayed during the game\n* Metacategory - The larger subject the category falls into (i.e. - History, Shakespeare, Film, etc)\n* Value - The face value of the clue, ranging from 200 to 1000 during the Jeopardy! round, 400 to 2000 during the Double Jeopardy! round, and 0 for Final Jeopardy!\n* Response - How I answered: Correct, Incorrect, Did Not Ring In, or (NEW for Regular Season games) Not Revealed\n* DD - Whether the clue was a Daily Double\n\n`jeopardy_coryats_complete.csv` includes the following columns:\n\n* Game - the episode ID number of the game (and the primary key for both tables)\n* Date - the date the episode aired\n* GameType - Second Chance Tournament or Champions Wildcard Tournament\n* MyCoryat - My Coryat Score\n* CombinedCoryat - the combined Coryat score for all contestants\n* Contestant1Coryat - Contestant 1's Coryat score\n* Contestant2Coryat - Contestant 2's Coryat score\n* Contestant3Coryat - Contestant 3's Coryat score\n* Contestant1FJ - Contestant 1's Final Jeopardy outcome (T for correct, F for incorrect)\n* Contestant2FJ - Contestant 2's Final Jeopardy outcome (T for correct, F for incorrect)\n* Contestant3FJ - Contestant 3's Final Jeopardy outcome (T for correct, F for incorrect)\n* Contestant1Win - Contestant 1's game outcome (T for win, F for lose)\n* Contestant2Win - Contestant 2's game outcome (T for win, F for lose)\n* Contestant3Win - Contestant 3's game outcome (T for win, F for lose)\n\n## Results and Findings\nCheck out `jeopardy_pt2.sql` to see the SQL queries I used for my analysis.\n\n### Overall performance\n|countcorrect|percentcorrect|\n|------------|--------------|\n|6878       |49.02         |\n\nMy overall percentage of correct answers was 49.02 percent, which is a decline from part 1's 50.90. But when you break it down by game type...\n\n| gametype                          | countcorrect | percentcorrect |\n|-----------------------------------|--------------|----------------|\n| Champions Wildcard Tournament     | 2595         | 50.64          |\n| Jeopardy!

The Jeopardy! Invitational Tournament and Tournament of Champions brought down my overall average quite a bit.\n\n#### Daily Double Performance\nOverall:\n\n| total | correctanswers | percentage |\n|-------|----------------|------------|\n| 683   | 247            | 36.16      |\n\nSplit out by Game Type:\n\n| gametype                          | total | correctanswers | percentage |\n|-----------------------------------|-------|----------------|------------|\n| Champions Wildcard Tournament     | 250   | 97             | 38.80      |\n| Jeopardy!

Compared to part one of the season, my accuracy in History and Geography increased (31.58 vs 25.64, and 36.36 vs 22.22), but my accuracy in Literature decresed (38.71 vs 45.45).\n\n| metacategory            | total | correctanswers | percentage |\n|-------------------------|-------|----------------|------------|\n| History                 | 38    | 12             | 31.58      |\n| Geography               | 33    | 12             | 36.36      |\n| Literature              | 31    | 12             | 38.71      |\n| Words                   | 28    | 13             | 46.43      |\n| Science                 | 17    | 5              | 29.41      |\n| People                  | 11    | 3              | 27.27      |\n| Music                   | 8     | 6              | 75.00      |\n| Culture                 | 6     | 3              | 50.00      |\n| Art                     | 5     | 0              | 0.00       |\n| Animals                 | 4     | 2              | 50.00      |\n| Politics                | 4     | 2              | 50.00      |\n| Religion                | 3     | 0              | 0.00       |\n| Landmarks               | 3     | 0              | 0.00       |\n| Business                | 3     | 1              | 33.33      |\n| States                  | 3     | 1              | 33.33      |\n| Pop Culture             | 3     | 2              | 66.67      |\n| Film                    | 3     | 2              | 66.67      |\n| Military                | 2     | 0              | 0.00       |\n| U.S. Cities             | 2     | 0              | 0.00       |\n| Organizations           | 2     | 0              | 0.00       |\n| Mythology               | 2     | 0              | 0.00       |\n| Languages               | 2     | 1              | 50.00      |\n| Crafts & Hobbies        | 2     | 1              | 50.00      |\n| Colleges & Universities | 2     | 2              | 100.00     |\n| Sports                  | 1     | 0              | 0.00       |\n| Technology              | 1     | 0              | 0.00       |\n| Shakespeare             | 1     | 0              | 0.00       |\n| Plants & Flowers        | 1     | 0              | 0.00       |\n| Theater                 | 1     | 0              | 0.00       |\n| Transportation          | 1     | 0              | 0.00       |\n| Monarchy                | 1     | 0              | 0.00       |\n| Law                     | 1     | 1              | 100.00     |\n| Fashion                 | 1     | 1              | 100.00     |\n| Food                    | 1     | 1              | 100.00     |\n| Television              | 1     | 1              | 100.00     |\n| Architecture            | 1     | 1              | 100.00     |\n| Folklore                | 1     | 1              | 100.00     |\n| Games                   | 1     | 1              | 100.00     |\n\nThe three most commonly-occurring Final Jeopardy! metacategories were Literature, History and People, and once again, my accuracy for the top two increased (37.50 vs 25 in Lit, 53.85 vs 14.29 in History), but decreased for the third place metacategory (55.56 vs 75 for People).\n\n| metacategory            | total | correctanswers | percentage |\n|-------------------------|-------|----------------|------------|\n| Literature              | 16    | 6              | 37.50      |\n| History                 | 13    | 7              | 53.85      |\n| People                  | 9     | 5              | 55.56      |\n| Geography               | 6     | 3              | 50.00      |\n| Music                   | 5     | 3              | 60.00      |\n| Science                 | 4     | 0              | 0.00       |\n| Business                | 3     | 0              | 0.00       |\n| Pop Culture             | 3     | 2              | 66.67      |\n| Film                    | 3     | 3              | 100.00     |\n| Words                   | 2     | 0              | 0.00       |\n| Landmarks               | 2     | 0              | 0.00       |\n| Languages               | 2     | 0              | 0.00       |\n| Theater                 | 2     | 2              | 100.00     |\n| Economics               | 1     | 0              | 0.00       |\n| Colleges & Universities | 1     | 0              | 0.00       |\n| Art                     | 1     | 0              | 0.00       |\n| Sports                  | 1     | 0              | 0.00       |\n| Animals                 | 1     | 0              | 0.00       |\n| Technology              | 1     | 1              | 100.00     |\n| States                  | 1     | 1              | 100.00     |\n| Organizations           | 1     | 1              | 100.00     |\n\n#### Confidence and win rate by metacategory\n\nStrong performance: Notable confidence and success in Pop Culture, Television, and Food (74.36/97.42, 80.69/100, 80.45/99.07, respectively).

Oddly enough, those averages increased for History and Geography, and Words only slightly decreased. So even though I'm becoming more confident and accurate in History and Geography, I'm leaving more potential money on the table in those categories. I suspect this is a side effect of more accurately \"knowing what I don't know\" -- now I just need to know more.\n\n| metacategory            | totalleft |\n|-------------------------|-----------|\n| History                 | 4881      |\n| Words                   | 4544      |\n| Geography               | 3471      |\n| Literature              | 3171      |\n| Science                 | 2372      |\n| Music                   | 1573      |\n| People                  | 1331      |\n| Film                    | 1097      |\n| Animals                 | 728       |\n| Culture                 | 697       |\n| Art                     | 683       |\n| Sports                  | 666       |\n| Religion                | 622       |\n| Pop Culture             | 579       |\n| Landmarks               | 440       |\n| Politics                | 395       |\n| Business                | 380       |\n| States                  | 375       |\n| Television              | 374       |\n| Plants & Flowers        | 325       |\n| Transportation          | 284       |\n| Food                    | 274       |\n| Monarchy                | 245       |\n| Mythology               | 219       |\n| Law                     | 194       |\n| Organizations           | 187       |\n| Theater                 | 186       |\n| Military                | 169       |\n| U.S. Cities             | 158       |\n| Languages               | 143       |\n| Colleges & Universities | 135       |\n| Technology              | 116       |\n| Shakespeare             | 108       |\n| Crafts & Hobbies        | 95        |\n| Games                   | 74        |\n| Folklore                | 56        |\n| Fashion                 | 52        |\n| Mathematics             | 46        |\n| Economics               | 25        |\n| Quotes                  | 25        |\n| Architecture            | 22        |\n| Unknown                 | 0         |\n\n### Comparisons To Contestant Performance\n\nDuring Regular Season Play, my overall Coryat average was 21,823, compared to an average combined contestant Coryat of 31,189. \n\nIn the first 80 games of the season, my Coryat never once matched or exceeded the combined contestant Coryat. However, there were 8 games in the remainder of the season where my Coryat score was equal to or greater than the contestant Coryat, which feels like promising progress!\n\nWhile my Coryat doesn't necessarily need to match or surpass the combined Coryat in order to win a game, I want to bridge that gap a bit, and my aim is still to get my average Coryat above 25,000. There were 51 games this season where I scored at or above 25k. Here's to bumping up that tally in Season 41!\n\n## So, What's Next For Season 41 (and beyond)?\nFirst, some exciting news: as of this writing, ***I'm back in the audition pipeline!*** This is just the jolt I need to keep that fire lit in my belly, and press on with my studying plan.\n\nSo with that in mind, I will continue tracking my Season 41 game performance in much the same manner as Season 40, but with a couple of tweaks:\n* Making use of [Jeopardata!](https://www.jeopardy.com/track/jeopardata) as an additional resource, which will help me assess my per-game performance on a more accurate, granular level.\n* Simplifying my Tableau dashboard to only show a few key stats and trends as the season progresses.\n\n### Studying Focus\nNarrowing down my target study subjects has been a great first step, but even so: I need to push harder to get that Coryat average up. I plan to get even more disciplined and strategic with these focus areas. I've already begun digging into some notable knowledge gaps and utilizing additional resources.\n\n#### U.S. Presidents & General American History\nI'm focusing on one president per day, doing a deep dive across various reference materials, and adding key information to a spreadsheet. I'll also do a crash course on wars and notable battles therein. \n\n#### Geography\nI'm drilling capitals, map locations, and bodies of water. I'm terrible with flags, and will tackle that next once I strengthen those other foundations.\n\n#### Words\nI've been keeping up with my daily New York Times puzzles and intend to continue. I've also been practicing Spanish, French and Italian on Duolingo, which will tangentially help with vocabulary and etymology.\n\n#### LearnedLeague Membership\nThanks to a referral from my friend Andy, I'm now a proud Llama! LearnedLeague is where many seasoned Jeopardy! superchamps go to quiz. In fact, Troy Meyer and Victoria Groce just duked it out in the LL Championships. The daily LL matches help keep my trivia chops sharp, and provide endless opportunities for new Wikipedia rabbitholes. \n\n#### Aural Learning\nI've found that I retain information well when hearing it, so in addition to the above, I plan to record voice memos of these subjects and listen to them on my commute and during work tasks.","metadata":{}}]}
